Progress builds of a Paper Mario inspired turn-based small numbers RPG, built in Unity.

Currently in progress on barebones combat system. Only jump command 'works' (sometimes it requires a page reload...).

Controls:
    
Overworld

    -WASD: Movement (In overworld)
    -SPACEBAR: Jump

Battle

    -A/D: rotate combat menu
        -ENTER: Select command (Jump command only one that works atm)
