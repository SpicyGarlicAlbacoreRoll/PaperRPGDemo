Progress builds of a Paper Mario inspired turn-based small numbers RPG, built in Unity.

Currently in progress on barebones combat system. Only jump command 'works' (sometimes enter won't work, but a mouseclick will work and subsequent enter will too).

V.3 Added enemies spawning (random count between 2 and 4) and populating battlestage (can only attack first enemy atm, can't select enemy either)
V.2 Added Realtime CSG Generated level
