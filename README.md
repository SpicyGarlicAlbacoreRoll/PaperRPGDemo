Progress builds of a Paper Mario inspired turn-based small numbers RPG, built in Unity.

Currently in progress on barebones combat system. Only jump command 'works' (sometimes enter won't work, but a mouseclick will work and subsequent enter will too).


V.4 Added enemy selector to combat. If enemy count is greater than two and any enemy after the 2nd is selected the player will get caught endlessly running into the first enemy. :sweat_smile:

V.3 Added enemies spawning (random count between 2 and 4) and populating battlestage (can only attack first enemy atm, can't select enemy either)

V.2 Added Realtime CSG Generated level
